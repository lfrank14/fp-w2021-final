# Peer Review
## David Fainstein Reviewing Group 2: Sarah, Wanjia, Meg, Lea

This is an exceptionally well put together draft. As I was traversing your code, I didn't have much to add on top of what you've already put together. Your code writing is clear and your supporting explanations are perhaps even better. It was tough to conduct a review that provide added benefit because, well, I don't really even know where to start with improvements. Celebrate your success with this draft, and take a look below for a few ideas that struck me:

## Strengths
1. You have incorporated features of the assignment into a coherent, usable blog post series. 
2. Your interlacing of code with text and supporting information/figures is strong. I learned a ton that reinforced my knowledge from reading your content
3. I think that the open-source nature of starting with real-world, accessible data that you clean and then run through the assignment components is so impressive!

## Areas of learning
1. Throughout my R learning adventure, I had always thought that creating categorical variables as factors and then naming took a fct_rename() or something like that. Lea's post on Data Cleaning had two different examples that showed off some of the elegance of factor()
2. Another point of learning was using the common.legend argument in ggarrange() for Wanjia's post. I was working on something similar for EDLD652's final project and never quite got it there. This code inspired a few thoughts that I could go back and change; thanks!

## Areas for Improvement
1. The primary area for improvement is aesthetics (and only stylistic for some tastes, hah). I made in-line edits on Meg's Looping post and Sarah's Writing Functions post. These were entirely to do with the visualizations. I didn't catch any grammatical or logical errors in your coding/write up. Again, this is such an excellent project in "draft" stage that I was really grasping at straws to find something to suggest as an area for improvement!
