```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Things to include:
- info about the data / link to source of data

Appologies, could only go over the website and give general reviews within the hour 

Strengths

Very helpful and detailed walk through!  Nice!! I’m definitely gonna reference this 

Helpful organization and flow of info for each of the tutorials! Appreciate the citations and variables/origins of the data used and the citation for the tutorials, a good reminder for me to be better about managing citations!
  
Always nice seeing/getting accustomed to regular expressions for the data cleaning tutorial! I have no idea what it means 

Effective use of referencing the other tutorials with in a tutorial! 


Improvement
Assuming the target audience is a coding weakling, such as myself, including brief comments after the first instance of a built in function (for those that aren’t explicitly stated in the text) could increase interpretability.

Not necessary and just adds more coding but coloring functions mentioned in the text blue could help with focusing attention. 

What I learned
Better understanding of function creation, looping, data cleaning ,and parallel iteration
