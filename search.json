The data was narrowed down to the following variables of interest:\r\n\r\nVariable Code\r\nDescription\r\nSEQN\r\nRespondent ID\r\nRIDAGEYR\r\nAge in years at screening\r\nRIAGENDR\r\nGender\r\nRIDRETH1\r\nRace/Hispanic origin\r\nDMDEDUC2\r\nEducation level (adults 20+)\r\nDMDEDUC3\r\nEducation level (children/youth 6-19)\r\nHHFDSEC\r\nHousehold food security category over last 12 months (1999-2002)\r\nFSDHH\r\nHousehold food security category over last 12 months (2003+)\r\n\r\nThe NHANES releases yearly survey data, with files separated based on demographics, questionnaire, health examination, and nutrition data. The data for this blog were downloaded from the following links: demographics and food security questionnaire (FSQ). Documentation regarding variable coding can also be found at those links.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Her research focuses on measuring attitudes associated with violent political extremism.\r\nWanjia Guo is a third year graduate student in Dr. Brice Kuhl’s Lab at the University of Oregon. She is currently interested in how the hippocampus helps us to distinguish between similar events.\r\nSarah Dimakis is a PhD student studying social psychology at the University of Oregon. She studies how people form moral character judgments of others and how those judgments change (or fail to change) over time.\r\nLea Frank is a doctoral candidate studying cognitive neuroscience at the University of Oregon. Her research focuses on how past experiences are used to help make new decisions and generate new knowledge, and how these functions are supported in the brain.\r\nLand Acknowledgement\r\nWe acknowledge that the University of Oregon is situated on Kalapuya Iliʔi—the ancestral territory of the Kalapuya people. As a University, we should honor the traditional stewards of this land and pay respect to the elders, both past and present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
