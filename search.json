Her research focuses on measuring attitudes associated with violent political extremism.\nWanjia Guo is a third year graduate student in Dr. Brice Kuhl’s Lab at the University of Oregon. She is currently interested in how the hippocampus helps us to distinguish between similar events.\nSarah Dimakis is a PhD student studying social psychology at the University of Oregon. She studies how people form moral character judgments of others and how those judgments change (or fail to change) over time.\nLea Frank is a doctoral candidate studying cognitive neuroscience at the University of Oregon. Her research examines how memories are used to help guide novel decisions.\nLand Acknowledgement\nWe acknowledge that the University of Oregon is situated on Kalapuya Iliʔi—the ancestral territory of the Kalapuya people. As a University, we should honor the traditional stewards of this land and pay respect to the elders, both past and present.\n\n\n\n",
